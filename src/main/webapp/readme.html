<h2>Mimi-Web Readme Page</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>This is the source for MiMI Web, the web site to access the MiMI
database.</p>
<p>It was obtained from the SVN archive with its main branch, latest
version, located at
http://developer2.ncibi.org/svn/MimiWeb/MimiWebR3/trunk/</p>
<p>This document contains a description of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the contents of the archive</li>
  <li>how to obtain the code that this archive depends on</li>
  <li>how to download from the SVN archive</li>
  <li>how to configure and install your working copy</li>
  <li>how to deploy the webapp to tomcat</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contents of the archive</h3>
<ul>
  <li>all the html, jsp, css, and image files for the display of the
site (in /src/main/webapp) </li>
  <li>all the java code support the jsp pages (in src and genfiles)
    <ul>
      <li>utilities and support</li>
      <li>access to a Lucene index of terms in the database</li>
      <li>access to the components of the database (mimi, gene, pubmed)</li>
      <li>the run-time parameter files</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>JUnit testing code (in test)</li>
  <li>the Jar files needed to compile codes and build the web
application (in lib)<br>
  </li>
  <li>build script with its parameter file (top level)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependencies - obtaining</h3>
<ol>
  <li>MiMI Web runs under Java 5; it has been tested under Java 6 and
will run under that compiler and runtime; but the current complie and
install scripts assume Java 5<br>
  </li>
  <li>MiMI Web is a web application that depends on a web application
enviroment like Tomcat, it has been run on Tomcat 5, and Tomcat 6;
obtain tomcat from http://tomcat.apache.org/</li>
  <li>The code for the site uses a number of compainion technologies,
you will not have to download any of these, because the jar files are
obtained and merged using the Maven build process, but they are listed
here for completness (see also pom.xml, in the top level folder):
    <ul>
      <li>The servlet API, servlet-api.jar</li>
      <li>Hibernate 3, hibernate3.jar, hsqldb.jar</li>
      <li>The JDBC interface support and connection for Microsoft SQL
Server, sqljdbc.jar </li>
      <li>The drw display tags (javascript library), dwr.jar,
displaytag-1.1.1.jar, displaytag-export-poi-1.1.1.jar, poi-3.0-FINAL.jar</li>
      <li>Additional JSP/javascripts tags, standard-1.0.6.jar</li>
      <li>Java PDF support, itext-1.3.jar</li>
      <li>XSLT support, jslt-1.1.2.jar</li>
      <li>Various 'commons' utilities, commons-bensutil-1.7.0.jar,
commons-collections-3.1.jar, commons-lang-2.3.jar</li>
      <li>Logging support, log4j-1.2.13.jar, slf4j-api-1.4.2.jar,
slf4j-log4j12-1.4.2.jar, jcl104-over-slf4j-1.4.2.jar</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>JUnit 4 support (supplied by Eclipse)</li>
  <li>You will need an SVN client (most Unix/Linux systems, including
MaxOS come with one; for windows TouriosSVN is an excellent choice
(http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/)</li>
  <li>These instructions are based on Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/)
    <ul>
      <li>You will probably want to use the Eslipse SVN plugin
(http://subclipse.tigris.org/)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Apache Maven (with pom.xml) is used to deploy and build this
file; http://maven.apache.org/; you will need the Eclipse plugin<br>
  </li>
  <li>Running of the site depends on the three MiMI-related databases,
mimi, gene, and pubmed. These are currently installed on Microsoft SQL
Servers servers in the domain bioinformatics.med.umich.edu; this domain
is behind a firewall so the web apps either needs to be installed
behind that firewall, or a VPN connection to that domain is needed
before the site will work.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Downloading and Installing in Eclipse - for development</h3>
<ol>
  <li>check the project out of SVN<br>
svn co
https://www.umms.med.umich.edu/codestore/ncibi/MimiWeb/MimiWebR3/trunk/
MimiWebR3</li>
  <li>if you have previously set this project up in Eclipse...<br>
remove the .projects and .classpath files and the .settings folder</li>
  <li>set up a Maven Projectn
eclipse - File -&gt; Import: General -&gt; Maven Projects (next); find
root dir; the project should appear; select it and click Finish<br>
  </li>
  <li>this should set up a Maven project in Eclipse<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Configure for the server</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In the top level directory, copy build.properties.template to
build.properties and edit that file (this configures the build and
deploy):<br>
set tomcat.webapps to point to the webapps directory of Tomcat</li>
  <li>In the src directory, copy mimiweb.properties.template
mimiweb.properties and edit that file (this configures the runtime
webapp), see the comments in that file for details</li>
  <li>In the WebContents directory, WEB-INF directory, copy
template.for.web.xml to web.xml; if the host name does not resolve
correctly edit this file; see the comments in the file for details</li>
</ol>
<h3>Building and deploying to the server</h3>
<ol>
  <li>In the top level directory, right click and select Run as...
-&gt;&nbsp; <b>maven package</b></li>
  <li><b>NOTE: </b>the 'standard' package build runs several test that
require direct access to the database. For this, you will either need
to be running on a machine that is behind the firewall or you will need
to be connected (via VNP) to the vpn server that is behind the
firewall, e.g. vpn.bioinformatics.med.umich.edu; you can deploy without
the test, see the Eclipse, Run Configurations dialog and create a new
Maven Run configuration with the goal 'package' and the tests disabled.<b><br>
    </b></li>
  <li>Copy the resulting war file, MimiWeb.war, to your tomcat's
webapps directory</li>
  <li>Restart the tomcat, if needed</li>
  <li>As configured, access the site at: http://host/MimiWeb/, for
example <a href="http://mimi.ncibi.org/MimiWeb/">http://mimi.ncibi.org/MimiWeb/</a></li>
</ol>
<h3>Testing the site</h3>
<p>Once deployed, the site should be tested with the following: </p>
<dl>
  <dt>probe.jsp</dt>
  <dd>Run this test by accessing the page (e.g. <a
 href="http://mimi.ncibi.org/MimiWeb/probe.jsp">http://mimi.ncibi.org/MimiWeb/probe.jsp</a>)
runs several sanity tests and list the properties of the site. Tests:
connection to the Lucene index,
conneciton to the hibernate interface, and the through the hibernate
interface connection to the databases, mimi, gene, and pubmed. </dd>
  <dt>index-pages.jsp</dt>
  <dd>Access this page (e.g. <a
 href="http://mimi.ncibi.org/MimiWeb/index-pages.jsp">http://mimi.ncibi.org/MimiWeb/index-pages.jsp</a>)
which contains a list of links to all the pages on the site. Run this
test by clicking through the links; each link should result in a page
that loads information. </dd>
